# SQL Data Warehouse (Medallion Architecture)

This is an ongoing project where I am implementing a Data Warehouse using
the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold).

## Current Progress

✔ Bronze schema created  
✔ Silver schema created  
✔ Basic ETL scripts for Bronze → Silver  
✔ Sample datasets for testing  
✔ Architecture & pipeline plan completed  

## In Progress

🔄 Gold layer transformations  
🔄 Performance tuning  
🔄 Dashboard integration  

## Tech Stack

- SQL Server / SQL Express  
- SSMS  
- Git  
- Draw.io (Architecture diagram)

## Project Goal

To build a simple warehouse setup that supports:
- Cleaned and conformed data in the Silver layer  
- Business-ready metrics (daily revenue, delivery performance, etc.) in Gold  
- ETL pipelines that automate the Bronze → Silver → Gold workflow

More updates coming soon.
